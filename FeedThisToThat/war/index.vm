I'm a velocity template processed using the VelocityViewServlet.

#if( $XHTML )
  #set( $br = "<br />" )
#else
  #set( $br = "<br>" )
#end

$br
$br

#set( $foo = "Velocity" ) 
Hello $foo World!
$br


$br
$br

Lets count : #foreach($i in [1..5])$i #end

$br
$br

Let's play with a hashmap:$br
first add foo: $map.put("foo",$foo)$br
then add bar: $map.put("bar",$bar)$br
$br
and that gives us $map

$br
$br

Here we get the date from the DateTool:  $date.medium

$br
$br

This is simple#if( $XHTML ) xhtml#end app version ${version}.

#if( $isSimple )
This is simple#if( $XHTML ) xhtml#end app version ${version}.
#end

Click <a href="index.jsp">here</a> to see the VelocityViewTag handle the same VTL markup.
